# Armenian Speech-to-text Models 

An exploratory repository searching for the most accurate Armenian transcription models and methods for academic use 

## Setup 

I'm using `uv` for my python dependency management. Check here[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/] for the docs. 

To install `uv`: 
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Make sure `uv` is up-to-date 
```
uv self update
```

When running in a new environment, you should build and activate your environment
